    "Today's challenge puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test. You already have the knowledge to complete this challenge, but check out the Tutorial tab for a video on testing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Task\n",
    "Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: .\n",
    "    If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, .\n",
    "    If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the .\n",
    "    If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of .\n",
